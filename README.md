# Mars-parallax


In Web Design, to make websites interactive, visually captivating and to better the overall user 
experiences, Parallax Web-design technique is used. Parallax website refer to websites creating a faux 
3D effect. As users scroll down a webpage, different layers of content or backgrounds move at different 
speeds, and this create an optical illusion.
Websites with parallax design technique gives it a dynamic experience unlike the traditional static feel. 
It is proved that this technique helps improve user engagement. Scrolling is easier than clicking. A well designed parallax effect engages users to scroll for more information.
To demonstrate the parallax effect in a website we decided to do an infographic on MARS! The objective of the 
website is to aid the user visually to effectively understand the information. This web-design technique helps to 
improve user engagement.
This technique can be implemented using various front-end technologies and frameworks like pure CSS, 
Parallax.js, and UI-KIT. However, they donâ€™t give you much flexibility to adopt the motions speeds of 
components on the screen the way the designer wants, also will ask you to structure your html page in a certain 
way. Therefore to implement the parallax effect on our infography we use JavaScript embedded in Html with CSS 
styling.
